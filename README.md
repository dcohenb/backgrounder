Backgrounder
==============

Simple taskbar utility that rotates a random background every set time.
The backgrounds come from a list I got and served via a simple api.

Downlaod
==============
If you want you can download the latest release right here:
- [Windows 64-bit](https://github.com/dcohenb/backgrounder/releases/download/0.0.1/backgrounder.exe)


Run On startup
==============
I plan on adding "run on startup" option in the settings, but until then you can place a shortcut to the downloaded binary under:
`%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`
